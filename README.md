amazon-vine
===========

This program is a Python script that checks the list of products on your Amazon Vine queue and notifies you if a new item becomes available.

If you don't know what Amazon Vine is, please read the Wikipedia page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Vine

Amazon Vine is an invitation-only program, and there nothing you can do to get an invitation, not even from other Vine members.  I have no idea why I was invited.
